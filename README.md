## About ##

Badly organised but hpefully useful scripts to make timelapse films from Canon EOS (Especially 400D).

lapse.pl is the main script.  It takes arguments decribing the output film,
then creates the directory given by `<NAME>` and proceeds to take photos with
your camera until the required number of frames is reached (or Ctrl+C pressed).

Then *lapse.pl* will use `ffmpeg` to encode a video from those JPG files, which it will then play with *mplayer*

## TODO ##

* Tidying of code and linkage between files.

* Configurable programs for encode, possibly, but definiely for playback.

* Easy-to-configure setup for various cameras.

* Possibly a GUI control of this script too.

## Usage ##

**USAGE:** `./lapse.pl <NAME> -I <interval> [-F <numframes> | -D <duration>] [--hookscript=/path/to/script]`

`-I` is interval, either in seconds or with 'm' suffix to denote minutes.
Eg.  '10m' means 1 photo every 10 min, and '1' means 1 every second.

`-F` Number of frames to capture.   You can omit this and use '-D' to specify the final video duration instead if you like.

`-D` Duration of final video, specified using same format as -I

`--hookscript`  This defaults to empty. However, provided is `hookscripts/hook_preview.pl` which attempts to show a preview of last image taken, using `./preview.pl`
See the gphoto2 documentation for more info on hookscripts

`--fps`  Frames per second of output video.  Defaults to 20 (slightly slower than normal film at 24)


`--sim` Run simulation, don't call gphoto2.  This uses `./camsim.sh`



## Requirements ##

Programs:

* sudo aptitude install gphoto2 ffmpeg # Core requirements

Perl libraries:

* sudo aptitude install libtime-duration-perl 

Optional (if you use the defaults, these are required):

* sudo aptitude install libgtk2-perl libgtk2-gladexml-perl # For preview.pl, as below
* cpan Gtk2::Ex::MPlayerEmbed; # For preview.pl, not needed if you omit, or use custom, hookscript
* sudo aptitude install mplayer # For movie preview functions, still somewhat Work in progress here.


## Configuring for your camera ##

Currently the program is targeting Canon EOS 400D
What you'll need to look at are the config settings for your camera.

See here: http://www.gphoto.org/doc/remote/

Also see the source of lapse.pl, where it says '## NOTE: Camera-specific settings here ##'
